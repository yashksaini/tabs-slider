          <h1>Personal Details</h1>
          <p>
            At 18 years old, I reside in the heart of Ajmer, Rajasthan,
            specifically at 14, Krishna Colony, near Dahresen Smarak. Ajmer's
            vibrant streets provide the perfect backdrop for embracing my
            extroverted nature.

          <p>
            Ajmer, with its historical significance and cultural blend, offers a
            unique setting for my daily life. Living in the Kotra region, I find
            myself part of a community that values tradition and hospitality.
